> ### types
>
> There is already a small set of primitive types available in JavaScript:**_boolean, bigint, null, number, string, symbol, and undefined_**, which you can use in an interface. TypeScript extends this list with a few more, such as **any** (allow anything), **unknown** (ensure someone using this type declares what the type is), **never** (itâ€™s not possible that this type could happen), and **void** (a function which returns undefined or has no return value).
